### Project Overview

This Power BI report analyzes bike sales across multiple European countries between 2011 and 2016. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of overall business performance through interactive KPI cards, time-series trends, country-level comparisons, and category-level insights. The dashboard supports decision-making by highlighting revenue growth, profitability shifts, and product contributions over time.

#### Dataset Description

The dataset contains over 110,000 sales records with fields including transaction date, customer demographics, product category, sub-category, pricing details, order quantity, revenue, and profit. Additional fields such as Year, Month, and Age Group were created through data transformation to support trend and segmentation analysis.

#### Dashboard Objectives

Summarize the company’s sales and profitability using key financial indicators.

Track revenue and profit trends over time using hierarchical date analysis (year, quarter, month).

Compare country-level revenue and profit to identify high-performing regions.

Understand the contribution of product categories (Bikes, Clothing, Accessories) to total revenue.

Measure year-over-year changes in revenue, orders, and profit margin between 2013 and 2015.

#### Key Performance Indicators
The dashboard includes six KPIs:

Total Revenue

Total Profit

Profit Margin

Revenue Percent Increase (2013 to 2015)

Orders Percent Increase (2013 to 2015)

Profit Margin Change (2013 to 2015)

All year-over-year metrics were calculated using DAX measures with supporting numerator and denominator logic. Additional display measures were created for improved readability and direction indicators.

#### Visualizations

Revenue and Profit by Country:
A comparative bar chart showing how each country contributes to revenue and profit. This helps identify top-performing markets and regions with strong margins.

Revenue Trend Over Time:
A line chart built on Power BI’s date hierarchy, allowing stakeholders to drill down by year, quarter, month, or day. This visualization exposes seasonality and long-term sales trends.

Revenue by Product Category:
A donut or bar chart illustrating the proportion of revenue generated by Bikes, Clothing, and Accessories. This highlights the product groups driving the business.

#### Data Preparation & Modeling

Power Query was used to clean and transform the dataset, including:

Changing data types

Extracting Year, Month, and Day

Creating Age Group bins

Removing errors and duplicates

The data model uses a single fact table with calculated columns and DAX measures. All KPI logic, percentage changes, and profitability calculations were implemented using DAX.

#### Technical Skills Demonstrated

Data cleaning and transformation (Power Query)

DAX measure creation, including YoY change calculations

Data modeling and relationship management

Interactive dashboard design and formatting

Business metrics definition and interpretation

How to Use the Dashboard

#### Stakeholders can explore:
