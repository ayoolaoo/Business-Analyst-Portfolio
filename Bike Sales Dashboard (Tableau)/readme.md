### Project Overview

This Tableau dashboard visualizes bike sales performance across multiple countries, product categories, and customer demographics. The goal is to provide decision-makers with a clear view of revenue trends, order activity, customer segments, and market performance through interactive charts and KPIs. The dashboard enables rapid insight into how sales evolved over time, how customer groups contributed to revenue, and how countries and product lines performed relative to each other.

#### Dataset Description

The dataset contains over 110,000 sales records with fields including transaction date, customer demographics, product category, sub-category, pricing details, order quantity, revenue, and profit. Additional fields such as Year, Month, and Age Group were created through data transformation to support trend and segmentation analysis.


### Dashboard Objectives

Provide a high-level summary of total sales and key performance changes.

Compare sales and order volume across years, highlighting growth or reduction.

Allow stakeholders to filter and drill into results by Country, Product Category, and Age Group.

Identify revenue contributions from different customer age groups.

Compare revenue and profit performance across six countries.

Visualize product category contributions to overall sales.

Display long-term sales trends from 2011 to 2016.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard includes three main KPIs:

Total Sales – Overall revenue generated across all years.

Sales in 2015 – Year-specific revenue with a 31.39% increase compared to prior available year.

Orders in 2015 – Total orders placed, showing a 1.79% decrease from the previous year.

These KPIs provide an immediate snapshot of annual performance and year-over-year changes.

### Visualizations Included

1. **Multi-Year Sales Trend (2011–2016)** : A line chart illustrating sales patterns across six years, highlighting seasonality, long-term growth, and fluctuations.

2. **Year Comparison Line Chart (2013 vs 2015)**: A dual-year trend chart that allows stakeholders to compare sales performance between 2013 and 2015, making it easy to see changes in peak periods and overall yearly behavior.

3. **Filters for Interactivity**
Interactive dropdown filters for:
- Country
- Product Category
- Age Group

These allow dynamic adjustments to all dashboard visuals, enabling quick drill-down into market segments.

4. **Revenue by Age Group**: A bar chart showing the distribution of revenue across different age categories, helping identify key customer demographics.

5. **Profit and Revenue by Country**: A side-by-side bar chart comparing six countries, showing both revenue and profit, making it easy to identify high-performing and low-performing regions.

6. **Product Category Sales Distribution**: A pie chart displaying the contribution of: Clothing, Accessories, Bikes. This highlights which category dominates total sales.
