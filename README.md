## Portfolio Projects
This section contains a list of completed projects as well as a brief descritpion of each project


## Hospital Management Dataset
**Code**: [Hospital Management Dataset.sql](https://github.com/ayoolaoo/Business-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Hospital%20Management%20Dataset.sql)

**Goal**: To analyze hospital operations by integrating patient, doctor, appointment, treatment, and billing data. The project focuses on understanding patient flow, doctor workload, treatment costs, and revenue patterns through multi-table joins, aggregations, and analytical SQL techniques.

**Description**: This project uses a multi-table hospital management dataset and performs end-to-end SQL analysis. Steps include exploring and joining relational tables (patients, doctors, appointments, treatments, billing), performing group-by aggregations, analyzing doctor performance and patient activity, evaluating revenue sources, and using window functions and subqueries to answer operational and financial questions. The analysis reveals insights into appointment trends, treatment frequency, revenue distribution, and healthcare service utilization.

**Skills**: SQL Joins (INNER, LEFT), Multi-Table Joins, Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG), Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER), Subqueries (scalar & IN), Grouped Analysis, Analytical SQL.

**Technology**: MySQL


## Bike Sales Data Exploration
**Code**: [Bike Sales Data Exploration.sql](https://github.com/ayoolaoo/Business-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Bike%20Sales%20Data%20Exploration.sql)

**Goal**: To clean, transform, and analyze a retail bike sales dataset by creating normalized tables, joining data sources, performing aggregations, ranking results, and using subqueries to answer business questions about revenue, customers, and product performance.

**Description**: This project uses a raw bike sales dataset and performs end-to-end SQL processing. Steps include Data Loading, creating new tables, altering and populating columns, splitting a flat table into customer and sales tables, joining datasets, performing group-by aggregations, applying window functions for top-N analysis, and using scalar and IN-subqueries for deeper insights. The analysis helps uncover revenue trends across countries, customer demographics, and product categories.
